# Nepali-Wedding-Rituals

Nepali weddings are elaborate, multi-day celebrations steeped in ancient Hindu traditions and enriched by diverse cultural practices from various ethnic communities, particularly the Newari traditions. These ceremonies represent far more than the union of two individuals—they symbolize the merging of two families, the fulfillment of sacred duties, and the beginning of a new chapter blessed by divine forces.

The wedding journey unfolds across three distinct phases, each with its own profound significance. The **Pre-Wedding Ceremonies** establish the sacred bond between families through formal betrothal, set auspicious dates through careful astrological consultation, and purify both the couple and their families in preparation for the sacred union. The **Wedding Day** itself marks the culmination of these preparations, where the couple takes their lifelong vows in the presence of the holy fire, witnessed by family, community, and the divine. Finally, the **Post-Wedding Rituals** focus on incorporating the bride into her new family and celebrating the newly formed bonds between the two households.

This comprehensive guide documents 29 essential rituals that comprise a traditional Nepali wedding, preserving the rich cultural heritage that has been passed down through generations. While modern couples may adapt or combine certain ceremonies, understanding these traditions offers invaluable insight into the spiritual, social, and familial values that continue to shape Nepali society.


## Phase 1: Pre-Wedding Ceremonies (Establishing the Bond and Purification)

These rituals focus on formalizing the engagement, setting the date, and purifying the couple and families before the marriage ceremony.

| No. | Ritual Name (Nepali) | Description |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Satyanarayan Puja | Blessing & Purification. This sacred worship of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Satyanarayan) is typically performed by both families in their respective homes about a week before the wedding. It is intended to seek divine blessings, ensure purification of the environment and the participants, and pray for the removal of all obstacles, guaranteeing a smooth and successful wedding ceremony. |
| 2 | Supari Satne / Kura/Bibiah Chinne (Newari: Gway Bigu) | The Betrothal & Verbal Consent. The groom's family formally visits the bride's house with gifts, including the auspicious Supari (betel nut), a coin (Dabal), and traditional sweets (Lakhmari). Bibiah Chhine is the formal verbal consent given by the bride's father after introductions and discussions. The bride's family's acceptance of the Supari formally seals the engagement contract between the two families. This ritual is the traditional equivalent of a modern engagement. Due to this alignment, many families now incorporate the exchange of rings and modern engagement practices into this step or into the subsequent Tika/Sagai ceremony (Step 4). |
| 3 | Lagan/Sahit Nikaalne / Lagan Patrika | Fixing the Auspicious Date. The family priests from both sides consult the horoscopes (Kundali) and elaborate astronomical charts to determine the most auspicious date and time (Sahit) for the entire wedding process. The Lagan Patrika is the printed document detailing this precise wedding timetable, which is often read aloud during the pre-wedding ceremonies. |
| 4 | Tika / Sagai | Formalizing the Promise & Acceptance. This ceremony formally confirms the betrothal. The two families exchange promises, and the couple often exchanges rings (in modern ceremonies) and applies tika (a sacred mark) to each other's foreheads, symbolizing mutual acceptance and the final bond before the wedding. The groom's sister often places a garland and tika on the bride to welcome her symbolically. |
| 5 | Saipata | Bridal Gifts Presentation. This ritual is the formal presentation of gifts from the groom's family to the bride. The groom's parents send elaborate, essential gifts (Saipata), including jewelry, bridal clothing, and cosmetics, to their would-be daughter-in-law, signifying the family's acceptance and commitment to her provision. |
| 6 | Mehendi Ceremony | Henna Application. This popular modern pre-wedding event involves the application of intricate henna (mehendi) designs on the hands and feet of the bride and female relatives. The dark stain of the henna symbolizes the depth of love and affection between the couple, and the ritual itself is a celebratory gathering filled with music and joy. |
| 7 | Purbanga | Planetary Appeasement. A crucial pre-wedding prayer ceremony performed at the groom's house, typically the day before the wedding. A priest conducts an elaborate prayer to inform the planetary bodies and the life elements (fire, water, earth) of the upcoming union, seeking to maintain equilibrium and peace for a blissful marriage. |
| 8 | Haldi / Pithi | Purification Ceremony. Turmeric paste (Haldi or Pithi), mixed with oil and sometimes sandalwood, is applied to the skin of the bride and groom at their respective homes. This ritual is believed to cleanse the body, ward off evil spirits, and impart a natural glow, preparing the couple spiritually and physically for the wedding day. |
| 8A | Kalya Bandhan (Newari) | The Binding Bangle. Specific to the Newari tradition, this takes place shortly before the wedding. The matchmaker and representatives from the groom's side visit the bride's home, where a silver kalya (bangle) is slipped onto the bride's wrist, signifying the final, irrevocable pre-marriage bond before the Janti departs. |
| 9 | Bride-Side Priti Bhoj (Reception) | The Bride's Feast. In some traditions, the bride's family hosts a large reception or feast before the main wedding ceremony. This gathering allows the bride's kin and community to celebrate her impending union and offer their blessings before she leaves her parental home. |

## Phase 2: The Wedding Day (The Sacred Union)

This is the main day of the marriage, culminating in the couple taking their lifelong vows in the presence of the sacred fire.

| No. | Ritual Name (Nepali) | Description |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| 10 | Janti (Arrival) | The Groom's Procession. The groom, traditionally wearing a Daura Suruwal and Topi, travels in a grand, often loud and celebratory procession to the bride's wedding venue. He is accompanied by his close family, friends, and traditional musicians (Panche Baja), symbolizing his journey to claim his bride. |
| 11 | Barani / Janti Swagat | Welcome of the Procession. The bride's father and key family members formally receive the Janti. This involves exchanging formal greetings, garlands, and often involves aarti (a lamp ceremony) to ward off evil and welcome the groom with warmth, dignity, and respect. |
| 11A | Jutta Lukaune | Hiding the Shoes. A playful, ubiquitous tradition where the bride's younger sisters or cousins ambush the groom upon his arrival and steal his shoes. The groom cannot depart for the Bidai (Step 22) until he engages in lively bargaining and pays a negotiated gift or sum of money to "buy back" his footwear, creating a lighthearted moment of family bonding. |
| 12 | Swoyambar (Jaimala) & Vows Ceremony | Garland Exchange & Formal Union. The key ceremony where the bride formally "selects" the groom by exchanging garlands (Jaimala), symbolizing mutual acceptance. The groom then places the Tilhari necklace and other essential jewelry on the bride, marking the commitment. (Note: For Newars, the main Sindoor ceremony is usually reserved for the Wanjala ritual in Phase 3). |
| 13 | Sindoor & Potey / Suhag Chino | Marking the Married Woman. The groom applies Sindoor (vermilion powder) to the parting of the bride's hair and places the Potey (a necklace of red glass beads) around her neck. This act, known as Suhag Chino (sign of a married woman), is the definitive ritual establishing her marital status. (This step is typically skipped in traditional Newari weddings.) |
| 14 | Dahi Khwaune / Mahur Khuwaune & Hridaya Sparsha (Newari: Chipanthike) | Sharing & Intimacy. The couple shares yogurt (Dahi Khwaune) or a traditional sweet (Mahur Khuwaune), feeding each other to symbolize a sweet and harmonious start to their life together. Hridaya Sparsha is a lighter moment where the husband and wife gently touch each other's hearts to promote intimacy and spiritual closeness after the solemn vows. |
| 15 | Supari Fukaune (Newari: Gwesakhe) (Bride Side Supari Ceremony) | Symbolic Release & Final Acceptance. The Supari accepted during the betrothal is symbolically returned to the groom's side during the Swayamvar, marking the release of the engagement agreement as the permanent marriage bond is formed. This ritual also incorporates the 'Bride Side Khwa Sweyegu,' where the bride's family visits the groom's home post-wedding for the final return of the betrothal suparis, signifying their ultimate satisfaction and acceptance of the marriage. |
| 16 | Kanyadaan | Giving Away the Bride. The bride's parents formally hand over their daughter's responsibility to the groom. In this deeply emotional ritual, the parents wash the hands of the bride and groom with milk and water, and then pour water over their joined hands, symbolically entrusting her future welfare to him. |
| 16A | Panigrahana | Acceptance of the Bride. Immediately following Kanyadaan, the groom holds the bride's hand (Pani meaning hand) and recites detailed Vedic vows, accepting her as his wife, companion, and partner. He promises to look after her health, happiness, and prosperity throughout their life together. |
| 17 | Vivah Homa / Agni Sakhshi | Sacred Fire Ritual. The priest lights the holy fire (Agni) in the Jagge (wedding altar). This fire serves as the divine witness (Agni Sakhshi) to the marriage, representing purity and divinity. Mantras are chanted and oblations are offered into the fire to seek blessings for the longevity and prosperity of the couple. (This ritual is often considered optional or unnecessary in traditional Newari weddings.) |
| 18 | Agniparikrama / Fera / Pheras | Circling the Fire. The couple walks clockwise around the sacred fire (Agni) four times, a ritual known as Fera or Pheras. This act seeks God's blessings, emphasizes loyalty, and symbolically places their commitment under the custody of the fire (Agni) as the divine witness. (This ritual is often considered optional or unnecessary in traditional Newari weddings.) |
| 19 | Saptapadi | The Seven Vows/Steps. Following the Agniparikrama, this is the definitive and most sacred marriage ritual, where the couple solidifies their union by taking seven ceremonial steps together (Sapta-Padi), each accompanied by a specific, detailed vow |
| 20 | Ashirvad & Tika | Blessings. After the marriage is solemnized, the newly married couple receives formal blessings (Ashirvad) and tika from all the elders and family members, who pray for their well-being, success, and long life together. |
| 21 | Bidai | The Farewell. The traditional, tearful departure of the bride from her parental home. The bride receives her final blessings and leaves with her husband and the Janti for her new home, marking the end of the ceremony at the bride's house. |

## Phase 3: Post-Wedding Rituals (Incorporation and Celebration)

These rituals focus on welcoming the bride into the groom's family and community.

| No. | Ritual Name (Nepali) | Description |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| 22 | Griha Pravesh / Dulahi Bhitryaune | Entry into the New Home. The bride is formally welcomed into the groom's house, often by the mother-in-law holding a special key (symbolizing the transfer of domestic responsibility) and guiding the bride in. The groom's sister performs Aarti (light) and applies tika. The bride ceremonially steps on small mounds of rice with burning butter lamps as she enters, signifying her arrival as the Goddess Laxmi (prosperity) of the home. |
| 22A | Bato Chekne (Newari/Hills) | Blocking the Path. At the main door of the groom's house, the groom's sisters or cousins playfully block the couple's entry, demanding a negotiated sum of money (a "toll") before they allow the bride to proceed into her new home. |
| 23 | Wanjala (Newari) | The Main Sindoor Ceremony. Performed on the morning after the wedding, typically at a local temple. The groom performs the definitive Sindoor ceremony on the bride's forehead, formally marking her as his wife. (This acts as the Newari equivalent to the main Sindoor application in Step 13). |
| 24 | Dhohbhet / Mukh Herne (Newari: Khwa Sweyegu) (Groom Side Supari Ceremony) | Formal Introduction & Blessing (Groom Side Acceptance). The groom introduces the new bride to his family. The bride distributes Supari and touches the feet of elders. The family responds by giving the bride money (dhohbhet) or jewelry as a welcome present. The bride often places a gold coin on a silver tray as a symbolic gift to each member. |
| 25 | Priti Bhoj / Groom-Side Reception (Biha Chweguh Bhwey) | The Grand Feast. The reception hosted by the groom's family to formally introduce the new bride to their community. It is often an informal, open-house style event with music and a buffet. |
| 26 | Durani Farkaune | The Bride's First Return. The bride makes her first return visit to her parent's home after the wedding, usually a few days later, often accompanied by the groom. |
| 27 | Jwain Bhitraune | Welcoming the Son-in-Law. A feast or ceremony hosted by the bride's parents to formally welcome the groom (Jwain) into their home as their son-in-law. |
| 28 | Samdhi Samdhini Bhetghat / Samdhini Bhet | Formal Exchange between Mothers. This is an informal but vital visit where the mothers of the bride and the groom (Samdhinis) meet at each other's households. Since the groom's mother traditionally stays home during the main wedding ceremony, this post-wedding exchange allows the two matriarchs to formally establish their bond, visit each other's homes, and exchange small gifts, solidifying the new, permanent relationship between the families. |
| 29 | Sora Din Ko Sait | Post-Wedding Visits. Meaning "Sixteen-Day Visits," this activity requires the bride and groom to visit the homes of senior relatives and community members who welcomed the bride and gave her token gifts. The couple reciprocates with small gifts as a mark of respect and acknowledgement. This integrated social ritual allows the new bride a chance to know the extended family circle and formally begin her integration into the groom's family and community within a specific timeframe (usually 16 days). |



### Step 19: Saptapadi - The Seven Vows/Steps

Following the Agniparikrama, this is the definitive and most sacred marriage ritual, where the couple solidifies their union by taking seven ceremonial steps together (Sapta-Padi), each accompanied by a specific, detailed vow. (This ritual is often considered optional or unnecessary in traditional Newari weddings.)
